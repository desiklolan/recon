# recon
This is a script to identify endpoints to attack. The tools used are:

* Amass
* ...
* ...

Configuration settings can be put in `config.py`. This script will not install the tools you need - take a look at [update-kali](https://github.com/rafaelh/update-kali) if you need something like that.
