# recon
This is a script to identify endpoints to attack. The tools used are:

* [Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)
* [Assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)
* [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)
* [DNSBuffer](https://tls.bufferover.run/dns?q=)

Configuration settings can be put in `config.py`. This script will not install the tools you need - take a look at my script [update-kali](https://github.com/rafaelh/update-kali) if you need something like that.
